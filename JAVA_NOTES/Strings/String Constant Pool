b. Interview Question

Difference Between String Method.

1. String s = new String("Ritik");

In this method String Create Two Objects.
One in the heap area and one in the String Constant pool.
String Constant pool is a memory area which is present in the heap area.
In this case we create two objects due to which our project become heavier and slow .

2. string s = "Rahul";

In this method String Create One Objects.
which is present in the String Constant pool.
In SCP case the garbage collection doesn't work because the object in the SCP is pointed by JVM Internally.
so many people use this method instead of the upper one.
