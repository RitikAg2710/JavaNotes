String Immutable means unchangeable.

If we change the value of object in heap area.

example :

String s = new String("Ritik");
s.concat(" Java")

1.This will not change the name Ritik Java instead of that it will create one more object in heap memory
of Ritik Java.
2.one object in the SCP named as Java.

Now one question Still remains why Strings are immutable ?
If we create a literal value in SCP as "Thane" by ref var City="Thane" if multiple persons point City Thane it will not create
multiple Object in SCP it will check if same name is present it will not create another one so if multiple persons point City="Thane"
and if among them one have to change His City name as "Kalyan" so it will affect several persons too so thats why Strings are Immutable.
