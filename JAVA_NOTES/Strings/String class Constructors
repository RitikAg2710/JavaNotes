what is Constructors ?
Constructors are special methods having same name of class name with no return type.

There are Six Important String Constructors :
    1. public String(){

    }

    2. public String(String s){

    }

    3. public String(StringBuffer sb){

    }

    4. public String(StringBuilder sc){

    }

    5. public String(char[] a){

    }

    6.public String(byte[] b){

    }

Important question which can be ask by Interviewers
Why char array is preferred over String for Storing Passwords ?
    1. String objects are immutable and it will create two objects one in String Constant pool and one in heap memory , scp is not applicable for garbage Collection
       so it will not be deleted by garbage collection which may occur as security threat.
    2. second point If we use a char array, his inside value will not be displayed, but if we use a string object, his value will be displayed.
        Example:
                    char[] a = new char[] {'a','b','c','d'};

                    String sb = new String("abcd");

                    System.out.println("char a:" +a);
                    System.out.println("String sb:" +sb);

        Output:
                    a: [c@586e0fd
                    sb: abcd
